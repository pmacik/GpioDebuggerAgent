This is an agent to be run on the ARM device, the only device supported is Raspberry Pi so far. Please note that the resulting jar file must be run under root privileges as the agent communicates directly with memory.
For users who want to make their own build on an ARM device, it is necessary to have Maven install and to copy contents of settings.xml file to the maven directory of superuser (for Raspberry Pi users with Raspbian the path is /root/.m2/settings.xml).
